	<p>I am currently the Assitant Dean of Student Life at CSU Puebo however, I have been a supervisor to creative production specialists like photographers and graphic designers since 2007. Therefore, I decided to pursue a degree in graphic design in 2020, to enhance my ability to teach and mentor staff.</p><p>As I work through my courses I have found a passion for creating corporate branding for print and web. I posses a strong understanding of color, typography and logo creation.</p><p>Please review my design work and pricing list available on my site.
